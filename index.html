          Mobile super apps present an emerging paradigm in the realm of mobile computing. These applications, which offer a plethora of services often in the form of “miniapps”, have experienced an accelerated growth trajectory in recent years. Specifically, the miniapps, analogous to native apps, have enabled super apps to construct a comprehensive ecosystem around themselves, akin to Google Play and the Apple App Store. By doing so, they not only enhance the host's functionalities, but also bestow an elevated level of convenience upon mobile users.
          <br><br>
          Nevertheless, the surging popularity of these apps, such as WeChat, Alipay, TikTok, and Grab, has resulted in an immense volume of user data being generated, stored, and transmitted via these platforms. With their integration of diverse services within a single platform or application, these super apps pose significant security and privacy challenges. This burgeoning issue has caught the attention of not just users, but also researchers and regulatory authorities.
          <br><br>
          In light of these developments, the Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy Superapps (SaTS 2024), co-located with ACM CCS 2024, is a highly relevant and timely event. Super apps are rapidly becoming indispensable tools for communication, entertainment, and commerce, while simultaneously raising crucial security and privacy issues. By fostering discussion and collaboration among researchers and practitioners, this workshop aims to address these concerns and provide insights and solutions to the security community, industry, and society at large. The objective of SaTS 2024 is to turn the spotlight on these concerns and foster an environment of knowledge exchange and problem-solving.

        <h1>Call for Papers</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 1.3rem">
          We invite researchers and practitioners to submit original research papers for the inaugural Workshop on Secure and Trustworthy Superapps (SaTS 2024), co-located with ACM CCS 2024. The aim of this workshop is to bring together experts from academia and industry to discuss and address the security and privacy challenges posed by the increasing use of mobile super apps.

          A mobile super app is a mobile app that hosts and supports other applications (i.e., miniapps), enabling their execution by using the platform's resources (also see W3C MiniApp Standardization White Paper, https://www.w3.org/TR/mini-app-white-paper/). Despite their huge usability gain for users, unique security and privacy challenges are arising. For example, it is challenging for the superapps to soundly manage the miniapps for their access to systems resources and the superapp's resources, nor can prior protection mechanisms in the domains of operating systems, browsers, virtulization directly be used for governing security here. Privacy concerns and questions also arise to keep up with citizen expectation, including but not limiting to data sharing transparency in the context of mobile superapps.

            <br><br>
            <b>Topics of interest in this workshop include, but are not limited to, the following categories:</b><br>
        </p>
        <ul style="font-size: 1.3rem">
            <li>Privacy-preserving techniques for mobile super apps (including their miniapps)
</li>
            <li>Security analysis of mobile super app ecosystems</li>
            <li>Authentication and authorization mechanisms for super apps</li>
            <li>Data protection and secure storage in super apps</li>
            <li>Privacy policies, compliance, and regulations for mobile super apps</li>
            <li>User behavior and privacy risk analysis</li>
            <li>Surveillance and censorship in mobile super apps</li>
            <li>Anonymity and pseudonymity in miniapp communication</li>
            <li>Security and privacy issues in third-party integrations</li>
