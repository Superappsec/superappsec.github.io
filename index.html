                Mobile super apps present an emerging paradigm in the realm of mobile computing. These applications,
                which offer a plethora of services often in the form of “miniapps”, have experienced an accelerated
                growth trajectory in recent years. Specifically, the miniapps, analogous to native apps, have enabled
                super apps to construct a comprehensive ecosystem around themselves, akin to Google Play and the Apple
                App Store. By doing so, they not only enhance the host's functionalities, but also bestow an elevated
                level of convenience upon mobile users. Nevertheless, the surging popularity of these apps, such as
                WeChat, Alipay, TikTok, and Grab, has resulted in an immense volume of user data being generated,
                stored, and transmitted via these platforms. With their integration of diverse services within a single
                platform or application, these super apps pose significant security and privacy challenges. This
                burgeoning issue has caught the attention of not just users, but also researchers and regulatory
                authorities.
                <br><br>
                Building on this evolving landscape, the integration of large language models (LLMs) into mobile apps
                opens a new research frontier, generating an unforeseen paradigm of LLM-empowered mobile super apps.
                Many of such LLM-driven apps, acting as autonomous agents with broad privileges, offer enhanced
                functionality by managing traditional miniapps, traditional mobile apps, and any other external tools
                (e.g., smart-home devices, third-party Web services) accessible to the super apps. Yet, this evolution
                also presents significant challenges, including potential data exposure and heightened cybersecurity
                risks. Addressing these concerns calls for new studies in secure architecture design, permission
                management, root trust frameworks, and innovative threat models for LLM-enabled mobile super app and
                super app development ecosystems.
                <br><br>
                In light of these developments, the ACM Workshop on Security and Privacy of AI-Empowered Mobile Super
                Apps (SaTS 2025), co-located with ACM CCS 2025, is a highly relevant and timely event. Super apps are
                rapidly becoming indispensable tools for communication, entertainment, and commerce, while
                simultaneously raising crucial security and privacy issues. By fostering discussion and collaboration
                among researchers and practitioners, this workshop aims to address these concerns and provide insights
                and solutions to the security community, industry, and society at large. The objective of SaTS 2025 is
                to turn the spotlight on these concerns and foster an environment of knowledge exchange and
                problem-solving.

                <b>Abstract:</b> <br>
                Permissions form the bedrock of computer security, enabling precise control over data access for users.
                However, the paradigm is breaking under the weight of modern system complexities, diverse application
                models, and dynamic usage patterns. We are seeing a reactive explosion of permission updates across
                operating systems and applications, to introduce flexibility, context-awareness, and dynamic policies.
                This rapid, uncoordinated evolution has created a "permission maze": developers are frustrated by the
                sheer complexity of implementing and securing these intricate access scenarios, while users are
                overwhelmed by the cognitive load of understanding and managing ever-growing combinations of data access
                rights. The current trajectory of incremental improvements leads to friction, not security. To
                fundamentally reinvent permissions, we must shift away from treating permissions as a reactive, complex
                gatekeeping mechanism to a proactive, intuitive system. This talk’s argument centers on empowering users
                with permission models that can delegate control over data by aligning with user-defined goals and
                intentions.

                <b>Bio:</b> <br>
                Dr. Mihai Christodorescu is a Research Scientist at Google, where he focuses on software security and
                privacy, especially for the mobile domain. His research interests are in fundamental approaches to
                computer security and privacy problems by combining methods from multiple domains, from programming
                languages, to machine learning, behavioral modeling, and formal methods. Most recently, he focused on
                translating progress in user authentication to software service authentication and on designing
                cryptographic techniques to allow users to disclose their personal data in flexible ways. He received
                his Ph.D. in Computer Sciences from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 2007. Dr. Christodorescu
                holds 25 patents and has published more than 35 papers in several international conferences and
                journals, including the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P), the ACM Conference on Computer and
                Communications Security (CCS), the USENIX Security Symposium, the Annual Computer Security Applications
                Conference (ACSAC), and many more.

                Emerging AI and LLM-powered mobile super apps—offering a range of functionalities through integrated
                external tools and traditional miniapps—have experienced rapid growth in recent years. Platforms such as
                Operator (by OpenAI), WeChat, Slack, TikTok and Alipay unite various external tools and miniapps to
                deliver services like payments, search, communication, and entertainment, thereby significantly
                enhancing functionalities and user convenience. However, the integration of these external tools and
                miniapps also introduces substantial security and privacy concerns, as large amounts of user data are
                generated, stored, and transmitted across interconnected systems.
                <br><br>

                Building on this evolving landscape, the integration of large language models (LLMs) into mobile apps
                opens a new research frontier, generating an unforeseen paradigm of LLM-empowered mobile super apps.
                These LLM-driven apps, acting as autonomous agents with broad privileges, offer enhanced functionality
                by managing traditional miniapps, traditional mobile apps, and any other external tools (e.g.,
                smart-home devices, third-party Web services) accessible to the super apps. Yet, this evolution also
                presents significant challenges, including potential data exposure and heightened cybersecurity risks.
                Addressing these concerns calls for new studies in secure architecture design, permission management,
                root trust frameworks, and innovative threat models for LLM-enabled mobile super app and super app
                development ecosystems.
                <br><br>

                We invite researchers and practitioners to submit original research papers for the new edition of the
                Workshop on Security and Privacy of AI-Empowered Mobile Super Apps (SaTS 2025), co-located with ACM CCS
                2025 (see last year’s workshop at https://superappsec.github.io/2024/). The aim of this workshop is to
                bring together experts from academia and industry to discuss and address the security and privacy
                challenges posed by the increasing use of AI-empowered mobile super apps.

                <br><br>
